# 📚 Blockchain-based Library Access

Welcome to a decentralized solution for library resource management! This project uses the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts to create a fair, transparent system for accessing digital library resources like e-books, articles, and educational materials. It solves real-world problems such as unequal access to limited resources, long wait times in traditional libraries, geographical barriers, and inefficient distribution by leveraging blockchain for immutable tracking, tokenized borrowing, and community-governed fairness.

## ✨ Features

🔑 Tokenized access to digital resources via NFTs for borrowing rights  
⏳ Time-bound borrowing with automatic returns to prevent hoarding  
📋 Fair waitlist system using FIFO queues and optional lotteries for high-demand items  
🏆 Reward tokens for contributors who upload or verify resources  
🗳️ DAO governance for adding/removing resources and setting distribution rules  
📊 Transparent analytics on resource usage and user behavior  
✅ Reputation system to prioritize fair users and penalize abusers  
💰 Micro-payment options for premium or rare resources  
🚫 Anti-abuse mechanisms to ensure equitable distribution across users

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Users (Borrowers)**  
- Register a user profile and build reputation through fair usage.  
- Browse available resources and join waitlists if needed.  
- Borrow a resource by minting a temporary NFT borrowing token (with a set expiration).  
- Access the resource off-chain (e.g., via IPFS links stored on-chain).  
- The system automatically returns the resource when the borrow period ends, freeing it for others.  

**For Contributors (Uploaders)**  
- Upload resource metadata (title, description, hash, IPFS link) and register it.  
- Earn reward tokens based on usage popularity.  
- Verify resource authenticity to prevent duplicates or fakes.  

**For Verifiers/Governors**  
- Use the DAO to vote on new resources or rule changes.  
- Check analytics for fair distribution insights.  
- Verify borrowings and reputations instantly via on-chain queries.  

This setup ensures fair resource distribution by limiting simultaneous borrows per resource, prioritizing users with good reputation, and using transparent queues. All transactions are immutable on the Stacks blockchain, reducing centralized control and enabling global access.

## 🔗 Smart Contracts Overview

This project involves 8 Clarity smart contracts to handle various aspects of the system securely and efficiently. Each contract is designed to be modular, with clear interfaces for interaction.

1. **ResourceRegistry.clar** - Registers new digital resources with metadata (hash, title, description, IPFS link). Prevents duplicates by checking unique hashes.  
2. **BorrowingNFT.clar** - Implements SIP-009 NFT standard for temporary borrowing tokens. Manages minting, burning, and transfers with expiration logic.  
3. **WaitlistQueue.clar** - Handles fair waitlists using FIFO logic or randomized lotteries for oversubscribed resources. Tracks positions and notifies users.  
4. **RewardToken.clar** - SIP-010 fungible token for rewarding contributors based on resource popularity (e.g., borrow counts). Includes staking for extra incentives.  
5. **GovernanceDAO.clar** - Enables community voting on proposals like adding resources or adjusting borrow limits. Uses token-weighted voting for fairness.  
6. **UserReputation.clar** - Tracks user borrowing history, calculates reputation scores, and applies penalties for overdue returns or abuse.  
7. **PaymentGateway.clar** - Manages optional STX micro-payments or token fees for premium access, integrating with Stacks' native token.  
8. **AnalyticsTracker.clar** - Logs and queries usage stats (e.g., borrow frequency, popular resources) for transparency and optimization.

These contracts interact seamlessly: For example, BorrowingNFT calls WaitlistQueue to check availability, and successful borrows update UserReputation and trigger rewards via RewardToken.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Set up a Stacks wallet and install the Clarity development tools.  
2. Deploy the contracts in order (starting with ResourceRegistry).  
3. Test interactions using the Clarity console: e.g., call `register-resource` to add a book, then `borrow-resource` to simulate access.  
4. Build a front-end dApp (e.g., with React) to interact with these contracts via the Hiro Wallet.

This project promotes equitable education and knowledge sharing in a decentralized world! If you have questions, dive into the contract code or experiment on the Stacks testnet.
